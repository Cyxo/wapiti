msgstr "It may be possible to find backup files of scripts on the webserver that the web-admin put here to save a previous version or backup files that are automaticallygenerated by the software editor used (like for example Emacs). These copies may reveal interesting informations like source code or credentials"

msgid "Backup file solution"
msgstr "The webadmin must manually delete the backup files or remove it from the web root. He should also reconfigure its editor to deactivate automatic backups."

msgid "Blind SQL Injection description"
msgstr "Blind SQL injection is a technique that exploits a vulnerability occurring in the database of an application. This kind of vulnerability is harder to detect than basic SQL injections because no error message will be displayed on the webpage."

msgid "Blind SQL Injection solution"
msgstr "To protect against SQL injection, user input must not directly be embedded in SQL statements. Instead, user input must be escaped or filtered or parameterized statements must be used."

msgid "Commands execution description"
msgstr "This attack consists in executing system commands on the server. The attacker tries to inject this commands in the request parameters"

msgid "Commands execution solution"
msgstr "Prefer working without user input when using file system calls"

msgid "CRLF description"
msgstr "The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \\r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \\n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today's popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command."

msgid "CSP \"{0}\" value is not safe"
msgstr "CSP \"{0}\" value is not safe"

msgid "CSP  is not set"
msgstr "CSP is not set"

msgid "CRLF solution"
msgstr "Check the submitted parameters and do not allow CRLF to be injected by filtering CRLF"

msgid "Cross Site Request Forgery description"
msgstr "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated."

msgid "Cross Site Request Forgery solution"
msgstr "Check if your framework has built-in CSRF protection and use it. If framework does not have built-in CSRF protection add CSRF tokens to all state changing requests (requests that cause actions on the site) and validate them on backend."

msgid "Cross Site Scripting description"
msgstr "Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts."

msgid "Cross Site Scripting solution"
msgstr "The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields. Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to users in an executable form. Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks by converting the following characters in all generated output to the appropriate HTML entity encoding:  &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, ', (, ), #, %, ; , +, -."

msgid "File Handling description"
msgstr "This attack is also known as Path or Directory Traversal, its aim is the access to files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. The attacker tries to explore the directories stored in the web server. The attacker uses some techniques, for instance, the manipulation of variables that reference files with 'dot-dot-slash (../)' sequences and its variations to move up to root directory to navigate through the file system."

msgid "File Handling solution"
msgstr "Prefer working without user input when using file system calls. Use indexes rather than actual portions of file names when templating or using language files (eg: value 5 from the user submission = Czechoslovakian, rather than expecting the user to return 'Czechoslovakian'). Ensure the user cannot supply all parts of the path - surround it with your path code. Validate the user's input by only accepting known good - do not sanitize the data. Use chrooted jails and code access policies to restrict where the files can be obtained or saved to."

msgid "Htaccess bypass description"
msgstr "htaccess files are used to restrict access to some files or HTTP method. In some case it may be possible to bypass this restriction and access the files."

msgid "Htaccess bypass solution"
msgstr "Make sure every HTTP method is forbidden if the credentials are bad."

msgid "Internal server error description"
msgstr "An error occured on the server's side, preventing it to process the request. It may be the sign of a vulnerability."

msgid "Internal server error solution"
msgstr "More information about the error should be found in the server logs."

msgid "Potentially dangerous file description"
msgstr "A file with potential vulnerabilities has been found on the website."

msgid "Potentially dangerous file solution"
msgstr "Make sure the script is up-to-date and restrict access to it if possible"

msgid "Resource consumption description"
msgstr "It took an abnormal time to the server to respond to a query. An attacker might leverage this kind of weakness to overload the server"

msgid "Resource consumption solution"
msgstr "The involved script is maybe using the server resources (CPU, memory, network, file access...) in a non-efficient way"

msgid "SQL Injection description"
msgstr "SQL injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to alter the queries executed on the backend database. An attacker may then be able to extract or modify informations stored in the database or even escalate his privileges on the system."

msgid "SQL Injection solution"
msgstr "To protect against SQL injection, user input must not directly be embedded in SQL statements. Instead, user input must be escaped or filtered or parameterized statements must be used."

msgid "Fingerprint web technology description"
msgstr "The use of a web technology can be deducted due to the presence of its specific fingerprints."

msgid "Fingerprint web technology solution"
msgstr "This is only for informational purposes."

msgid "HTTP Secure Headers"
msgstr " HTTP security headers tell the browser how to behave when handling the website's content"

msgid "HTTP Headers Secure Configuration"
msgstr "Use the recommendations to hardening your HTTP Security Headers "

msgid "Content Security Policy description"
msgstr "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks"

msgid "Content Security Policy solution"
msgstr "Configuring Content Security Policy involves adding the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header to a web page and giving it values to control what resources the user agent is allowed to load for that page"
